#      bio: "Originally from Israel, I arrived to Australia in 2011 for a PhD at the University of the Sunshine Coast, developing surrogate biotechnology for the bluefin tuna industry, using advanced molecular and genomics methods. I joined Griffith University in 2016 as a postdoc, which quickly evolved to a lecturer (Biosciences) and research fellow position at the Centre for Planetary Health and Food Security. I bring comprehensive knowledge, skills and expertise in molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics to study crop and pathogen genomics, crop-pathogen molecular interactions and to develop novel pathogen diagnostics methods. I aspire to develop applied research solutions in tight collaboration with the agriculture and aquaculture industries to overcome diseases and other production bottlenecks to help future food security."
